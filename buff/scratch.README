About Scratch

Scratch is an extension to Emacs that enables one to create scratch
buffers that are in the same mode as the current buffer.  This is
notably useful when working on code in some language; you may grab
code into a scratch buffer, and, by virtue of this extension, do so
using the Emacs formatting rules for that language.
