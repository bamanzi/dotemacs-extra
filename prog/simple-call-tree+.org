** Introduction
 This library is based on simple-call-tree.el by Alex Schroeder, but you
 do not need that library to use it (this is a replacement).
 It displays a buffer containing a call tree for functions in source
 code files. You can easily & quickly navigate the call tree, displaying
 the code in another window, and apply query-replace or other commands
 to individual functions.

 When the command `simple-call-tree-display-buffer' is executed
 a call tree for the functions in the current buffer will be created.
 The user is also prompted for other files to include in the call tree.
 The call tree is displayed in a buffer called *Simple Call Tree*,
 which has a dedicated menu in the menu-bar showing various commands
 and their keybindings. Most of these commands are self explanatory
 so try them out.

** Navigation
 You can navigate the call tree either by moving through consecutive
 headers (n/p or N/P keys) or by jumping to main branches (j for branch
 corresponding to function at point, and J to prompt for a function).
 When you jump to a branch, it is added to `simple-call-tree-jump-ring',
 and you can navigate your jump history using the </> keys.
 You can also add the function under point to the jump-ring with the . key.
 If you use a negative prefix (e.g. C--) before pressing j then the branch
 jumped to will not be added to the jump-ring.
 If you have fm.el (available here: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/sje30/emacs/fm.el)
 you can press f to toggle follow mode on/off.

** Display
 Normally child branches correspond to functions/variables called by the parent
 branch. However, if you invert the tree by pressing i then the child branches
 will correspond to functions that call the parent branch.
 You can sort the tree in various different ways, and change the depth of the tree.
 You can also narrow the tree to the function at point by pressing /

** Refactoring
 You can perform `query-replace' or `query-replace-regexp' on the function at
 point by pressing % or C-%, or any other arbitrary command by pressing !
 This may be useful when refactoring.

** Exporting
 The tree can be exported in its current state with the `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'
 command, and you can alter the TODO state and types of links using options `simple-call-tree-org-todo-state',
 and `simple-call-tree-org-link-style'. This may be useful for project management.

* Customizable options
You can customized the following options with: M-x customize-group simple-call-tree RET

 - `simple-call-tree-default-recenter'
    How to recenter the window after moving to another function in the "*Simple Call Tree*" buffer.
 - `simple-call-tree-default-valid-fonts'
    List of fonts to use for finding objects to include in the call tree.
 - `simple-call-tree-default-invalid-fonts'
    List of fonts that should not be in the text property of any valid token.
 - `simple-call-tree-default-sort-method'
    The default sort method to use when a call tree is newly created.
 - `simple-call-tree-default-maxdepth'
    The depth at which new call trees should be displayed.
 - `simple-call-tree-major-mode-alist'
    Alist of major modes, and information to use for identifying objects for the simple call tree.
 - `simple-call-tree-org-link-style'
    Style used for links of child headers when exporting org tree using `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'.
 - `simple-call-tree-org-todo-state'
    TODO state to add to toplevel headers when exporting org tree using `simple-call-tree-export-org-tree'.
 - `simple-call-tree-jump-ring-max'
    Maximum number of elements in `simple-call-tree-jump-ring', before old elements are removed.
* Installation

 - If you have [[http://www.marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade-repo.org]], this simple-call-tree+ is part of the emacs packages you can install.  Just type M-x package-install simple-call-tree+ marmalade 
 - Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:simple-call-tree+, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
 - Add (require 'simple-call-tree+) in your ~/.emacs file
