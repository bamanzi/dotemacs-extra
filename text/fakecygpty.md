As noted in the Cygwin archives[1], an NTEmacs build doesnâ€™t know how to
present itself as a cygwin tty device when running cygwin commands.  As a
possible workaround, someone smart has come up with `fakecygpty`[2].  When
compiled from within cygwin according to the instructions, you get a nice
little shim program which does present the expected tty interface.  The
command to run then becomes

  c:\Program Files\Emacs\emacs-24.3\bin>fakecygpty ssh my_server

which works nicely for me!
